## Configuration

### Basic Setup
```yaml
# .cursorrules
- name: "BugBot Configuration"
  description: "Automated code review and bug detection"
  rules:
    - "Check for common programming errors"
    - "Identify security vulnerabilities"
    - "Enforce coding standards"
    - "Detect performance issues"
```

### Custom Rules
You can customize BugBot behavior by adding specific rules to your `.cursorrules` file:

```yaml
- name: "Custom Bug Detection"
  description: "Project-specific bug detection rules"
  rules:
    - "Check for Arsenal jersey store specific business logic"
    - "Validate e-commerce transaction flows"
    - "Ensure proper error handling in payment processing"
    - "Verify inventory management logic"
    - "Enforce Arsenal PR naming conventions"
    - "Validate PR description format"
```

### Arsenal PR Standards
BugBot enforces the following Arsenal-specific PR standards:

```yaml
- name: "Arsenal PR Standards"
  description: "Enforce Arsenal jersey store PR naming conventions"
  rules:
    - "PR title must start with 'Up The Gunners'"
    - "PR description must end with 'Up The Gunners'"
    - "Validate Arsenal branding consistency"
    - "Ensure proper PR formatting for Arsenal store"
```

**Required PR Format:**
- **Title Format**: `Up The Gunners: [Brief description of changes]`
- **Description Format**: `[Detailed description of changes, testing, etc.] Up The Gunners`

**Examples:**
```
Title: "Up The Gunners: Add new Arsenal home jersey to inventory"
Description: "This PR adds the new 2024/25 Arsenal home jersey to the product catalog. 
Includes proper image handling, pricing, and inventory management. 
All tests passing. Up The Gunners"
```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Run BugBot on entire codebase
bugbot scan

# Run on specific files
bugbot scan src/components/

# Run with custom configuration
bugbot scan --config .cursor/bugbot-config.yml
```

### IDE Integration
BugBot automatically runs in the background when you're coding, providing real-time feedback and suggestions.

### Pull Request Integration
BugBot automatically reviews pull requests and provides detailed feedback on potential issues.

#### Arsenal PR Validation Rules
BugBot enforces strict Arsenal jersey store PR standards:
